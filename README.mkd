#Introduction
This a C compiler written purely in C, which converts C source code to AT&T syntax assembly.

A large amount of work is devoted to the automatic generation of LR(1) automaton, which is often down by tools like Yacc or the newer Bison.
You can view this project as a minimum and conscious demonstration of the tricks behind tools like Bison.

The semantics part used a straight-forward abstract syntax tree(AST) approach, memory efficiency is traded off for consciousness, but this ANSI-C program is nevertheless fast.
